Getting it Online: 
------------------

Once you've made and tested your changes, submit a pull request and then ping
pop about it. 

There is currently a post-commit hook to get the machine hosting
lug.oregonstate.edu to automatically pull from this repo and run wok whenever
code gets committed here. It is imperfect so you may need to ping pop on
irc.freenode.net in the #osu-lug-admin channel (or in a pm)
