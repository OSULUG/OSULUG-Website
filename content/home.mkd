### What is the Oregon State University Linux Users Group

We are self described as "mostly a group of nerds. However we are not your
normal nerds. We are a highly active and self-organizing group dedicated to
teaching and advocating free and open source software (FOSS) on campus."

That might sound like we are on a bit of a high horse; put simply we are a
group of students and community members in and around Oregon State University
that believe in the use of and contribution to [Free and Open Source
Software][foss] (FOSS). In practice this means we contribute to the tools we
use and the use the tools we love.

If you don't yet use Linux, or you want to learn more about FOSS, come to a
meeting. We don't bite -- but we might offer you pizza.

### How do I participate?

Participation is completely voluntary and non-compulsory; show up to a meeting
when you can at any point during the Fall, Winter, Spring term.

When are are not at meetings, we keep in touch via...

* the OSULUG [mailing list][ml] where we post about events and useful
  information, and
* the `#osu-lug` IRC channel on `irc.freenode.net`.
    * For more info on IRC, check out our [guide to getting on IRC][ircguide].

**If you're currently an OSU student and would like to become an official
voting member of LUG**, please fill out this [member form][form].

Keep an eye out for helpful information and upcoming events posted here. We
also have lunch together on Fridays, at a time determined in the IRC channel.

LUG is also on [GitHub][gh] if you would like to read our Laws and the source
code for this website.

### Is there anything else like LUG at OSU?

The [DevOps BootCamp][dobc] program, run by the [Open Source Lab][OSL], teaches
students how to develop web applications (think: Facebook, Twitter, etc)
software and run Linux servers (think: The Cloud). This program is free to
attend, no strings attached.
