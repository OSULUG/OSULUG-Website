Here's a page to find out current opportunities for students looking for 
internships, jobs and other kinds of work or volunteer gigs. 

[Google Summer of Code][GSOC] is a place where currently enrolled students can
get paired with an open source project and mentor(s) to hack on open issues and
feature requests in real projects with real impact!  There is a stipend and you
are expected to work for the summer.

[Outreachy][Outreachy] is similar to GSOC but specifically targets
under represented groups in technology.  A fantastic organization with really
good mentorship.  Again, paid and you will work on FOSS.

The [Free Software Foundation][FSF] has unpaid interships in Boston.  So if you
_really_ love libre software, this might be for you!  Due date April 30th.
