We keep in touch via the [mailing list][ml], and via the `#osu-lug` IRC
channel on `irc.freenode.net`. For more info on IRC, check out our [IRC
guide][ircguide].

Even if you aren't a member, feel more than free to subscribe to the mailing
list or hang out in the IRC channel. We are a helpful and friendly group and do
not bite.
