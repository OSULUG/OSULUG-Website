We at the Linux Users Group are mostly a group of nerds. However we are not
your normal nerds. We are a highly active and self-organizing group dedicated
to teaching and advocating free and open source software (FOSS) on campus.

Our approach is simple. Members join either because they are new users and
would like help, or because they are active users and want to help promote
FOSS.  Because of the infectious nature of open source, the group nearly builds
itself.

We have benefited the Oregon State student body by providing free support for
Linux, increasing awareness about the open source revolution, and jointly
creating events with other groups on campus. We share many members with the
[OSU Open Source Education Lab][osel] and are hosted by the [OSU Open Source
Lab][osuosl].

We have open meetings every Tuesday at 6:00 pm in the Dearborn EECS Library.
To get to the Library, just go up the stairs near the elevator, take a right,
and then take another right. From there, it is straight ahead.
